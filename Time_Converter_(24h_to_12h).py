"""
Your task is to convert the time from the 24-h format into 12-h format by following the next rules:
- the output format should be 'hh:mm a.m.' (for hours before midday) or 'hh:mm p.m.' (for hours after midday)
- if hours is less than 10 - don't write a '0' before it. For example: '9:05 a.m.'

Input: Time in a 24-hour format (as a string).

Output: Time in a 12-hour format (as a string).
